## Introduction

This is an academic personal website template based on [bootstrap](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-new-age).

The template is designed to integrate Markdown files as content input.  There's no need to compile the webpage before deployment.  Upon loading, the Markdown files are automatically parsed and embedded into the page.

This template supports LaTeX formula input. You can use `$...$` and `\(...\)` as delimiters for inline-math, or use `$$...$$` and `\[...\]` as delimiters for display-math. Macros such as `\ref{...}`, `\eqref{...}`, and `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` are also supported. See [MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html) for more details.
